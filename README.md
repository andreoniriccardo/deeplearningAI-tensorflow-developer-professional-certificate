# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
This specialization is composed of 4 independent courses.

In this document, for each course, I summarize what I learned, how it enhanced my data scientist skills and what programming assignment consists to.

This GitHub repository contains all the coding material that I wrote and studied for this specialization.

## 01 - [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)

### How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I am familiar with the TansorFlow programming environment and its API
- I know how to build a convolutional neural network which is able to classify the input images
- I mastered the use of the `ImageDataGenerator` function

### What does this course deal?
- The "hello world" in TensorFlow
- Exploring the **Fashon MNIST** dataset
- Using **callbacks** in neural networks
- **Convolutions** and **pooling** layers
- **`ImageDataGenerator` function**
- **Image compression**

### Coding assignments
- **House Prices**: building a neural network that predicts the price of a house.
- **Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow**: using the Fashon MNIST dataset, implementing a neural network that uses callbacks to control training
- **Improving the MNIST with convolutions**
- **Handling Complex Images**: use more complex images to build a convolutional neural network
