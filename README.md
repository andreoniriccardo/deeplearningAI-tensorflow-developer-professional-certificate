# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization
This specialization is composed of 4 independent courses.

In this document, for each course, I summarize what I learned, how it enhanced my data scientist skills and what programming assignment consists to.

This GitHub repository contains all the coding material that I wrote and studied for this specialization.

## 01 - [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)

### How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I am familiar with the TansorFlow programming environment and its API
- I know how to build a convolutional neural network which is able to classify the input images
- I mastered the use of the `ImageDataGenerator` function

### What does this course deal?
- The "hello world" in TensorFlow
- Exploring the **Fashon MNIST** dataset
- Using **callbacks** in neural networks
- **Convolutions** and **pooling** layers
- **`ImageDataGenerator` function**
- **Image compression**

### Coding assignments
- **House Prices**: building a neural network that predicts the price of a house.
- **Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow**: using the Fashon MNIST dataset, implementing a neural network that uses callbacks to control training
- **Improving the MNIST with convolutions**
- **Handling Complex Images**: use more complex images to build a convolutional neural network

# 02 - [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/home/week/1)

### How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I can go through all the steps required to build an efficient convolutional neural network for image classification in TensorFlow
- I can perform both binary and multiclass classification, and I built complete CNN using large datasets
- I know different tools to reduce overfitting in my convolutional neural network, such as data augmentation and dropout
- I learned how to build customized CNNs starting from state-of-the-art networks (like InceptionV3 or MobileNet) thanks to transfer learning


### What does this course deal?
- Cat vs. Dogs classifier
	- inspecting the datases
	- **building a classifier in TensorFlow**
	- data preprocessing in TensorFlow
	- model predictions and **model evaluation**
- **Data augmentation** in TensorFlow
