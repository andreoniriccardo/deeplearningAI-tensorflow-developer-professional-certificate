# [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/home/week/1)

## How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I can go through all the steps required to build an efficient convolutional neural network for image classification in TensorFlow
- I can perform both binary and multiclass classification, and I built complete CNN using large datasets
- I know different tools to reduce overfitting in my convolutional neural network, such as data augmentation and dropout
- I learned how to build customized CNNs starting from state-of-the-art networks (like InceptionV3 or MobileNet) thanks to transfer learning


## What does this course deal?

- **Transfer learning** in TensorFlow
	- Coding transfer learning from the **Inception** network
- **Dropout** in TensorFlow
- **Multiclass classification** in TensorFlow

## Coding assignments
- **Cats vs. Dogs**: building a convolutional neural network to classify cats and dogs in images.
- **Data Augmentation**: implementing data augmentation to improve the neural network performance and reduce overfitting.
- **Transfer Learning**: implementing transfer learning to build an effective horse vs. human neural network classifier, starting from the InceptionV3 network.
- **Classification Beyond two classes**: using the [Sign Languade dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) from Kaggle build a multiclass classifier neural network
