# [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)

## How did this course enhance my Data Science skills?
- I learned how to retrieve and to prepare a dataset for Natural Language Processing applications, which includes tokenizing, padding and embedding, besides removing common stopwords.
- I know how to define and train a model for NLP in TensorFlow.
- I know how to build NLP models for tasks like sentiment analysis, categorization of news articles, and auto-completing sentences.


## What does this course deal?
- Word based **encoding**
- **Text to sequence**
- **Tokenizer**
- **Padding**
- **Detecting sarcasm** in text
- Word **embeddings**
- **Models for NLP**
- Long Short Term Memory algorithm (**LSTM**)
- **Evaluating a NLP model**
- **NLP** with **convolutional networks**
- **Auto-completing** the sentences


## Coding assignments
- **BBC news archive - 01**: retrieving the BBC text archive, tokenizing the dataset and removing common stopwords
- **BBC news archive - 02**: building a neural network to determine the category of the articles contained in the BBC news archive.
- **Exploring Overfitting in NLP**: training a NLP model on large datasets and implementing transfer learning.
- **Predicting the next word**: using Shakespeare sonnets to train a model able to auto-complete sentences.
